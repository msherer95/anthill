# Anthill

Anthill is a port of Ant Design to SolidJS. Anthill has two main goals:

1. Make Ant Design available for SolidJS projects.
2. Create a highly customizable, and hopefully somewhat futureproof UI library.

The first goal is pretty straightforward. We want to use Ant Design in SolidJS projects. Ant Design is a beloved UI library for it's full-featured compponents, and clean design. The original Ant Design library can be quite challenging to customize, so our goal is to make Anthill easy to customize. We focus on straightforward global customization using our theme object (as most UI libraries tend to do), and a clean CSS implementation for individual components, making them easy to override with regular CSS classes.  

The goal is to make Anthill light, yet full-featured and easy to customize. We want to make it easy to use Anthill component functionality, while transforming the component designs to perfectly fit your custom design system.

Once upon a time, everyone loved Bootstrap, then Material became king; now developers seem to be searching for alternatives like Ant Design and Chakra. What we've learned from these patterns is we can't expect a library to be popular forever. In fact, we expect it to lose popularity in the future. That's why we're so heavily emphasizing Anthill's customizability. Ant Design might fall out of favor at some point, but you should always be able to take advantage of Anthill as a base for your custom design system that might look nothing like Ant Design.
